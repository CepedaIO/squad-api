Hey Jake,

I really enjoyed our talk the other day, I'm certain the restructuring will make a significant difference at Havenly

Havenly asked me a great question at one point "If you were the CEO and could change anything, what would you do?" and I want
to share my honest, bare thoughts with you

Havenly has some of the best engineers I've ever seen

Corey - Knight/Viking
Steve - Secret Agent/Martial Artist
David - Superman/Gandalf

and with great mentality comes great personality... and attitude...

Take me for instance...

Me - (button down, shorts, slippers)/(white tshirt, khakis, sneakers) *hands in pocket, looking up at sky*

I'm definitely pretty weird, I'm a bit of a loner, in my dingy little hole and only like to come out for the occasional
praise... recognition... and maybe a beer or two (once in a blue moon)

I can be pretty hard to motivate but when I am motivated, I do a lot of good work... and I'm happy to do it

I can only speak for myself, but I know other developers that agree...

What I want is

# Competitive salary and benefits
# Work-life balance
# Education and career advancement
# Trust
# Women and Fame
# Ownership

Over the years I've learned there's two things in particular that keep me around the longest and that's
~~Women and Fame~~ Trust and Ownership. Most the other stuff is taken cared of :), I'm pretty stubborn about my 40 hours
